> This is an experimental project that aims to rewrite the original batch scripts (e.g., `.sh`, `.bat`) in the [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) source code using the [Hulo](https://github.com/hulo-lang) language.
> By transforming imperative shell scripts into declarative Hulo code, the project explores modern script practices and maintainability.
